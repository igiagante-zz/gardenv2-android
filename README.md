# The Garden

The garden app helps it`s user improve the process of growing plants using historical data and responding to certain alerts.  
The development of this app started when I was looking for an idea for the final project of Udacity NanoDegree. I wrote a capstone project and it was approved by Udacityâ€™s Team. This document explains in detail how the app is designed. However, since the app has been growing constantly and the project has started being too big, I decided to split it up in two parts. The first part of the project ( implemented ) has the following functions:

* Every time an entity is created, the app checks if that entity name already exists. It cannot persist an entity with the same name.

* Create and log users.

* Garden
  * One garden contains plants, irrigations and charts.
  * To start using the app, the user should create a garden.
  * A garden can not be deleted if it contains plants.
  * It can filter the plants list using the search view.
  * The humidity and temperature showed at the garden are from the weather api.
